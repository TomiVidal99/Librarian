## TODO:

- [ ] FIX: prevent from adding folders with a lot of recursion on 'origin folders'.
- [ ] FIX: in general settings (and some other elements) there should be tooltips, to further explain what's up.
- [ ] FIX: check that the destination folder to be added it's not used anywhere else.
- [ ] FIX: move all filtering an processing logic to the reducer.
- [ ] FIX: should add pop up alerts when a folder or some other data is not correct.
- [ ] FIX: add more type checking to filters, expecially if a filter like format is added with a dot '.', should parse that correctly.
- [ ] FIX: color contrast on filters when hovered.
- [ ] FIX: if a filters window it's opened, the user can't open another and the one opened should pop up in front.
- [ ] FIX: notification messages.
- [ ] FIX: Check duplicates on adding new folders.
- [ ] FIX: Overflow of list items.
- [ ] FIX: Add shadows to button and selects.

- [ ] FIX: classnames in the origin folders.
- [ ] FIX: language not syncronizing properly with translation files.
- [ ] ADD: frontend to activate/deactivate file organization when just launched (all files that already exists inside folders).
- [ ] ADD: recursion to the origin folders.
- [ ] ADD: better animation when hovering Section, expand, better bg color and shadows.
- [ ] ADD: shift + click to select multiple items in lists.
- [ ] ADD: pop up a warning when adding more than 6 (?) filters, not adviced, maybe think of adding more folders, or using regex or format.

- [ ] ADD: arias to buttons.
- [ ] ADD: a Checkbox element.
- [ ] ADD: navigation.
- [ ] ADD: styled Buttons for adding and deleting (green and red).
- [ ] ANIMATION: for the Section when it's hovered, fill the border with a different color like a loading animation.

- [ ] IMPROVE: organize all ipcMain handlers better.
